Simply Solid is a super simple app to apply solid colors as wallpapers.
It has a color chooser dialog where user can choose color from presets or from custom hex code and a simple animated TextView showing the actual applied solid wallpaper's color. The color of the TextView is the complementary color of the applied color.
There's is also a function to determine if the applied color is light or not used to change the toolbar/status bar color to dark or light
The app supports 3.0+ devices.
